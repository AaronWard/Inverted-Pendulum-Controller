# Inverted-Pendulum-Controller-
In order to stabilize a pendulum in this inverted position, a feedback control system can be used, which monitors the pendulum's angle and moves the position of the pivot point sideways when the pendulum starts to fall over, to keep it balanced. The inverted pendulum is a classic problem in dynamics and control theory and is widely used as a benchmark for testing control algorithms. Using a fuzzy Logic System, an inverted pendulum is balanced on a moving cart
